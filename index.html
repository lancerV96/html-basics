An image is a visual representation. An image can be two-dimensional, such as a drawing, painting, or photograph, or
three-dimensional, such as a carving or sculpture. Images may be displayed through other media, including projection on
a surface, activation of electronic signals, or digital displays; they can also be reproduced through mechanical means,
such as photography, printmaking or photocopying. Images can also be animated through digital or physical processes.
    </P>
    <P class="p-info">
    A volatile image exists or is perceived only for a short period. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a
    projection of a camera obscura, or a scene displayed on a cathode-ray tube. A fixed image, also called a hard copy, is
    one that has been recorded on a material object, such as paper or textile.
